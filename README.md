## Introduction

This Instagram Clone project is a part of my personal journey to gain in-depth understanding and proficiency in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By recreating the well-known Instagram platform, I'm challenging myself to tackle real-world problems, design considerations, and features common to many web applications.

From managing state and props, to implementing React Router for page navigation, to using CSS modules for styling, this project covers a variety of fundamental and advanced concepts in React. While this project is primarily for educational purposes, I also hope it serves as a demonstration of my ability to build complex and functional web applications.
